if else and elif statement are a multiway decision taken by our progrm due to certain conditions in our code
syntax:
if (condition1):
    print("yes")
elif(condition2):
    print("no")
else:
    print("maybe")

Relational opertors: are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statement. ==,>=,<=.
logical operators: and ,or ,not
 elif clause: same as elseif. if can be chained with lot of elif statement follwed by else statement
  if(coditions1):
    #code
elif(conditions2):
    #code
elif(conditions3):
    #code
..
..
else:
     code
there can be any no of elif statement
last else is executed only if all the conditions inside elif fail.
